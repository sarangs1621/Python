## Contributing:
You are welcome to contribute to this project and add new features. Currently only the basic mathematical operations are available (add, subtract, multiply, etc) so there are still plenty of room for more improvements as well as styling.

## üêû Known Bugs:
- App crashes when dividing by 0
- Users can type values directly into the Tk.Entry which shouldn't be allowed
- Errors when pressing the `=` button
